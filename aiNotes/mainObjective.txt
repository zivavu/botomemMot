Main Objective:

Create a Margonem bot that operates in the background by capturing the browser window directly (not just screenshots of the foreground). The bot will:
- Continuously grab the content of the Margonem browser window.
- Use image processing to detect enemies on the screen.
- Move the character to the detected enemy and initiate a quick fight automatically.
- Repeat the process, allowing for unattended, automated gameplay.

The solution should be robust, efficient, and able to work even when the game window is minimized or not in focus.
