# Margonem Bot Implementation Notes

## Current Implementation
- Using Playwright to interact with the browser window
- OpenCV template matching to detect enemies on the game canvas
- Image processing to find sprites that match enemy templates
- Click handling to target enemies and initiate combat

## Possible Improvements

### Enemy Detection
- Implement multiple template sizes for better matching (enemies may appear in different sizes)
- Add enemy priority list based on level or item drops
- Use feature detection algorithms like SIFT/SURF for more robust matching
- Implement a neural network model for more accurate enemy recognition with PyTorch or TensorFlow

### Bot Logic & Autonomy
- Add pathfinding to navigate around obstacles
- Implement map awareness to farm efficiently in specific areas
- Add health/mana monitoring to retreat when necessary
- Create an inventory management system for loot and consumables
- Add automatic potion usage during combat

### User Interface
- Create a GUI dashboard with Tkinter or PyQt
- Add real-time statistics (enemies killed, items collected, etc.)
- Implement configuration profiles for different farming strategies
- Add visual debugging mode to see recognition in real-time

### Safety Features
- Add random delays between actions to appear more human-like
- Implement break periods to avoid detection
- Add captcha detection/avoidance

### Combat Optimization
- Analyze combat effectiveness and prioritize weaker enemies for faster farming
- Implement skill rotation based on enemy type
- Add automatic equipment switching for different enemy types

## Technical Challenges
- Handling animations and visual effects that may interfere with recognition
- Dealing with varying network latency that affects gameplay timing
- Adapting to game updates that change UI or mechanics
- Handling different screen resolutions and scaling factors

## Future Research
- Investigate if the game has API endpoints that could be leveraged
- Research Margonem's network traffic for useful data
- Explore if WebSocket communications can be monitored/used
